## Installation Setup

### Physical Layout
- **Speaker Array:**  
  - QSC K10.2 units arranged in a perimeter arc (floor + head level)  
  - Two elevated QSC K10.2s at the front for height cues  
  - Neumann KH120 used for clarity and spatial detail  
  - Alto Professional TS18C Subwoofer centrally placed  

- **Control Station:**  
  - MacBook Pro 14" running Unity + OSC  
  - Nulea M512 Wireless Trackball Mouse  
  - Midas M32 serving as mixer *and* audio interface  

- **Visual System:**  
  - Projector displaying Unity’s matrix world + reactive avatar  
  - Depth-sensing camera mounted front-left or centered  
  - Optional Roland V-1HD for blending camera + Unity output

## Space Requirements
- Medium-large room (20–30 ft), open industrial layout  
- Dim lighting to enhance projection contrast  
- Sufficient distance between audience and projection wall for safety  
- Enough circulation room for multiple users to move freely

## User Journey

### 1. Arrival
Visitors walk into a dim room illuminated by the matrix projection and a pulsing humanoid figure.

### 2. Onboarding
A facilitator briefly explains:
- How to use the trackball  
- How movement affects the system  
- What to expect sonically and visually  

### 3. Interaction
- Users spatialize stems using the Nulea M512 trackball  
- Their movement affects tempo and visual reactivity  
- The installation cycles through stem sets across the evening  

### 4. Ending / Reset
After a period of inactivity, the system returns to a calm, default loop until the next participant engages.

## Visual & Sonic Design

### Visuals
- Matrix-inspired shader grid  
- HSV ramping effects tied to sound regions  
- Stylized humanoid figure pulsing with data streams  

### Sound
- 8 musical sets × 4 stems  
- IEM spatialization via Reaper  
- Subtle tempo changes based on group movement

## Accessibility & Inclusivity
- Open floor plan with no required reach constraints  
- Trackball mouse usable while seated or standing  
- Visual indicators support those with reduced hearing  
- Moderate levels ensure safe auditory exposure

## Reflection

### What Worked Well
- Strong coherence between visuals, sound, and interaction  
- Trackball panning felt intuitive and engaging  
- Spatial system adapted well to the unique architecture of Underground Atlanta  

### Challenges
- Variability in crowd detection required filtering  
- Latency occasionally varied depending on machine load  
- Some projection alignment challenges in an industrial space  

### Future Improvements
- Expand gesture classification (MediaPipe, OpenCV)  
- Smoother transitions between musical scenes  
- Fully portable version using standalone Unity builds and integrated audio processing
